An *R Commander* Plugin for Basic (Bio)Statistical Routines  
-->

# R Commander Plug-in for Basic Data Management and Analysis Tasks

**RcmdrPlugin.biostat** is an
[**Rcmdr**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcmdr) plug-in for the
most common data wrangling, visualization, and analysis tasks. In the
package, **tidyverse** family functions, as well as functions from other
packages, are used. The documentation is available at
[gegznav.github.io/RcmdrPlugin.biostat](https://gegznav.github.io/RcmdrPlugin.biostat).

## Install the package

### Preparation

Before you begin installation or updating, make sure that only a single
*R*/*RStudio* session is running and restart the current *R* session (to
unload the packages). It is also recommended to close the current
*RStudio* project if you use one. *Windows* users need
[*Rtools*](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and *Mac*
users need [*XQuartz*](http://www.xquartz.org/) to be installed (see
also [Notes for *Mac* users only](#notes-for-mac-users-only)).

### Installation

To install the development version of the package from “GitHub”:

``` r
# Update all necessary CRAN packages
update.packages(ask = "graphics")

# Install required packages
if (!require("remotes"))  install.packages("remotes")

# Install RcmdrPlugin.biostat
remotes::install_github(
  "GegznaV/RcmdrPlugin.biostat", 
  dependencies = TRUE, upgrade = TRUE
)
```

In case you face installation issues, follow the instructions in the
error message. You may also try removing `upgrade = TRUE` and manually
choose the packages to update. It is always recommended to restart *R*
session before the next installation too.

> **NOTE:** the most common installation issue is related to *R* package
> **rlang**. Usually, you have to delete the indicated “*00LOCK*”
> directory (you may use
> [`pacman::p_unlock()`](https://trinker.github.io/pacman/p_unlock.html),
> if you have package [**pacman**](https://trinker.github.io/pacman)
> installed, or delete the directory manually), restart the current *R*
> session and try to install again.

### Check for updates

To get the most recent version of **RcmdrPlugin.biostat** and to check
if all its dependencies (other packages) are installed, use package
[**bio**](https://mokymai.github.io/bio/):

``` r
# remotes::install_github("mokymai/bio")
bio::update_pkg_rcmdr_biostat(upgrade = TRUE)
```

Again, if installation errors occur, you may use `upgrade = "ask"` and
manually choose the packages to update.

### Previous versions

If you need a previous version of the package, read section “[Previous
versions of
**RcmdrPlugin.biostat**](#previous-versions-of-rcmdrpluginbiostat)”
below.

## Load the plug-in

The easiest way to load **RcmdrPlugin.biostat** in *BioStat* (green)
mode is to use RStudio addin:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GegznaV/RcmdrPlugin.biostat/master/inst/etc/fig/00-addin-to-load-biostat-mode.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Alternatively, use code:

``` r
library(Rcmdr)
library(RcmdrPlugin.biostat)
load_rcmdr_biostat_mode()
```

*Mac* users should also read “[Notes for *Mac* users
only](#notes-for-mac-users-only)”.

<!-- Package **RcmdrPlugin.biostat** can be loaded programmatically or by using menus: -->

<!-- a) *Option 1.* Run code: -->

<!--     ```{r eval=FALSE} -->

<!--     library(RcmdrPlugin.biostat) -->

<!--     load_rcmdr_biostat_mode() -->

<!--     ``` -->

<!-- b) *Option 2.* Run code: -->

<!--     ```{r eval=FALSE} -->

<!--     options(Rcmdr = list(plugins = "RcmdrPlugin.biostat", console.output = FALSE)) -->

<!--     library(Rcmdr) -->

<!--     set_biostat_mode() -->

<!--     ``` -->

<!-- c) *Option 3:* use *RStudio* and *R Commander* menus (see sections "[Load by using menus](#load-by-using-menus)" and "[Turn on *BioStat* (green) mode](#turn-on-biostat-green-mode)"). -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- *Mac* users should also read "[Notes for *Mac* users only](#notes-for-mac-users-only)". -->

<!-- **Next**, for some of the options above, the *BioStat* mode should be turned on by using commander (see section "[Turn on *BioStat* (green) mode](#turn-on-biostat-green-mode)"). -->

<!-- ### Load by using menus {#load-by-menu} -->

<!-- 1. Load package **Rcmdr** by either selecting **Rcmdr** in *RStudio* „Packages“ menu: -->

<!--     ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=CAPTION} -->

<!--     knitr::include_graphics(paste0(fig_dir, "01--load-rcmdr-in-rs.png"))  -->

<!--     CAPTION = "" # Figure caption/description. -->

<!--     ``` -->

<!--     Or by using *R* code:  -->

<!--     ```{r eval=FALSE} -->

<!--     library(Rcmdr) -->

<!--     ``` -->

<!--     Wait until *R Commander* window opens. -->

<!--     <br> -->

<!-- 2. Then load the plug-in (as well as the other necessary plug-ins) through  -->

<!-- `Tools` → `Load Rcmdr plug-in(s)...` in the *R Commander* menu bar. -->

<!--     ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=CAPTION} -->

<!--     knitr::include_graphics(paste0(fig_dir, "02--load-plugin--biostat.png"))  -->

<!--     CAPTION = "" # Figure caption/description. -->

<!--     ``` -->

<!--     If you need more than one plug-in to be loaded, hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key while selecting the plug-ins. -->

<!-- To load the plug-ins, *R Commander* must restart. -->

<!-- > **NOTE:** be aware that some plug-ins are incompatible one to the other and  -->

<!--         some combinations of plug-ins may break *R Commander*  -->

<!--         (e.g., "RcmdrPlugin.EZR" and "RcmdrPlugin.EZR.as.menu"). -->

<!--         In this kind of situations, you should restart *R* session and try the  -->

<!--         other combinations of plugins. -->

<!-- > **NOTE:** if "RcmdrPlugin.biostat" is not between the options of Plugins, it  -->

<!--         means that the plugin is already chosen but not included in the menus of  -->

<!--         *R Commander*. This means that you should restart the *R Commander* by  -->

<!--         using function `restart_commander()`{.r}. -->

<!-- <br> -->

When **RcmdrPlugin.biostat** is loaded, you can access its functionality
through `BioStat'20` menu in the menu bar:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GegznaV/RcmdrPlugin.biostat/master/inst/etc/fig/03--biostat-plugin-loaded.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Turn on *BioStat* (green) mode

If you restarted R Commander and “BioStat” menu is present, you may
re-enable *BioStat* mode:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GegznaV/RcmdrPlugin.biostat/master/inst/etc/fig/04--activate-biostat-mode.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<br>

### Close *BioStat* mode

To close this mode, simply restart the *R Commander*:

  - R Commander menu bar → BioStat’20 → Session → Restart R Commander

You may use the following command as well:

``` r
restart_commander()
```

### Notes for *Mac* users only

For *Mac* users, there at least 2 things to pay attention to:

1)  On *Mac*, *R Commander* opens only if
    [*XQuartz*](http://www.xquartz.org/) is opened. So, the first step
    of using *R Commander* is to make sure that *XQuartz* is opened.
    More information on [“Installing R Commander for *Mac*
    users”](https://murraystate.instructure.com/courses/1252125/pages/installing-r-commander-on-your-mac).

2)  Some *Mac* users also report that it is impossible to switch between
    languages while *R Commander* is running. This means, that some
    users might not use numbers if in the chosen language the same keys
    mean some non-English letters. Because of this, it is recommended to
    choose an appropriate language (usually English) before opening
    *R*/*RStudio*.

-----

## Button bar in *BioStat* (green) mode

In this mode, additional buttons, which enable access to the most common
functions, are added below the menu bar:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GegznaV/RcmdrPlugin.biostat/master/inst/etc/fig/05--buttons-in-biostat-mode.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

**NOTE:** If an active dataset is not selected, some buttons are shaded
in gray and are inactive.

<br>

# The other useful packages

Other useful **Rcmdr** plug-ins:

1.  **RcmdrPlugin.EZR.as.menu** – an *R Commander* plugin for the most
    common statistical analyses (functionality is the same as in
    **RcmdrPlugin.EZR**, except that **RcmdrPlugin.EZR.as.menu** creates
    a separate “EZR” menu in a menu bar and does not reorganize the
    original **Rcmdr** menus in the menu bar);
2.  **RcmdrPlugin.KMggplot2** – an *R Commander* plugin for **ggplot2**
    graphics.

To install these packages, use the following code:

``` r
# RcmdrPlugin.EZR.as.menu
remotes::install_github("GegznaV/RcmdrPlugin.EZR", ref = "ezr_as_menu")

# RcmdrPlugin.KMggplot2
install.packages("RcmdrPlugin.KMggplot2")
```

After the packages are installed, you can load them programmatically:

``` r
options(Rcmdr = list(
  plugins = c(
    "RcmdrPlugin.KMggplot2",
    "RcmdrPlugin.EZR.as.menu",
    "RcmdrPlugin.biostat",
    NULL
  ), 
  console.output = FALSE
))

library(Rcmdr)
```

If package **Rcmdr** is loaded **and R Commander window is closed**,
instead of ~~`library(Rcmdr)`~~, use this code **exactly once**:

``` r
Commander()
```

# Important

Some functions in the package are based on and modified from functions
in packages *Rcmdr*<!--, *RcmdrPlugin.KMggplot2*-->, and
*RcmdrPlugin.EZR*. All of those packages are under the GPL-2/GPL-3
license.
