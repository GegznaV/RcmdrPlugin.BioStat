An *R Commander* Plugin for Basic (Bio)Statistical Routines

R Commander Plug-in for Basic Data Management and Analysis Tasks {#intro}
==============================================================================

**RcmdrPlugin.biostat** is an [**Rcmdr**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcmdr) plug-in for the most common data wrangling, visualization, and analysis tasks. 
In the package,  **tidyverse** family functions, as well as functions from other packages, are used.
The documentation is available at [gegznav.github.io/RcmdrPlugin.biostat](https://gegznav.github.io/RcmdrPlugin.biostat){target="_blank"}.


## Install the package {#install-the-package}

### Preparation

Before you begin installation or updating, make sure that only a single *R*/*RStudio* session is running and restart the current *R* session (to unload the packages).
It is also recommended to close the current *RStudio* project if you use one.
*Windows* users need [*Rtools*](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/){target="_blank"} and *Mac* users need [*XQuartz*](http://www.xquartz.org/){target="_blank"} to be installed (see also [Notes for *Mac* users only](#notes-for-mac-users-only)).


### Installation

To install the development version of the package from “GitHub”:

```{r Install package, eval=FALSE}
# Update all necessary CRAN packages
update.packages(ask = "graphics")

# Install required packages
if (!require("remotes"))  install.packages("remotes")

# Install RcmdrPlugin.biostat
remotes::install_github("GegznaV/RcmdrPlugin.biostat", upgrade = TRUE)
```

In case you face installation issues, follow the instructions in the error message.
You may also try removing `upgrade = TRUE`{.r} and manually choose the packages to update.
It is always recommended to restart *R* session before the next installation too.

> **NOTE:** the most common installation issue is related to *R* package **rlang**.
Usually, you have to delete the indicated "*00LOCK*" directory (you may use [`pacman::p_unlock()`{.r}](https://trinker.github.io/pacman/p_unlock.html){target="_blank"}, if you have package [**pacman**](https://trinker.github.io/pacman){target="_blank"} installed, or delete the directory manually), restart the current *R* session and try to install again.


### Previous versions

If you need a previous version of the package, find the section "[Previous versions of **RcmdrPlugin.biostat**](#previous-versions-of-rcmdrpluginbiostat)" below.



## Load the plug-in correctly {#load}

Package **RcmdrPlugin.biostat** can be loaded programmatically or by using menus.
*Mac* users should also read "[Notes for *Mac* users only](#notes-for-mac-users-only)".

a. *Option 1.* Run code:

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    library(RcmdrPlugin.biostat)
    restart_commander()
    ```
    A pop-up window appears.
    Agree to restart.


b. *Option 2.* Run code:

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    options(Rcmdr = list(plugins = "RcmdrPlugin.biostat", console.output = FALSE))
    library(Rcmdr)
    ```

c. *Option 3:* use *RStudio* and *R Commander* menus (see section "[Load by using menus](#load-by-using-menus)").

<br>

**Next**, the *BioStat* mode should be turned on (see section "[Turn on *BioStat* (green) mode](#turn-on-biostat-green-mode)").


### Load by using menus {#load-by-menu}

1. Load package **Rcmdr** by either selecting **Rcmdr** in *RStudio* „Packages“ menu:

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=CAPTION}
    knitr::include_graphics(paste0(fig_dir, "01--load-rcmdr-in-rs.png")) 
    
    CAPTION = "" # Figure caption/description.
    ```
    Or by using R code: 
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    library(Rcmdr)
    ```
    Wait until *R Commander* window opens.
    <br>

2. Then load the plug-in (as well as the other necessary plug-ins) through 
`Tools` → `Load Rcmdr plug-in(s)...` in the *R Commander* menu bar.

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=CAPTION}
    knitr::include_graphics(paste0(fig_dir, "02--load-plugin--biostat.png")) 
    
    CAPTION = "" # Figure caption/description.
    ```
    If you need more than one plug-in to be loaded, hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key while selecting the plug-ins.
To load the plug-ins, *R Commander* must restart.

> **NOTE:** be aware that some plug-ins are incompatible one to the other and 
        some combinations of plug-ins may break *R Commander* 
        (e.g., "RcmdrPlugin.EZR" and "RcmdrPlugin.EZR.as.menu").
        In this kind of situations, you should restart *R* session and try the 
        other combinations of plugins.
  
  
> **NOTE:** if "RcmdrPlugin.biostat" is not between the options of Plugins, it 
        means that the plugin is already chosen but not included in the menus of 
        *R Commander*. This means that you should restart the *R Commander* by 
        using function `restart_commander()`{.r}.

<br>

3. When **RcmdrPlugin.biostat** is loaded, you can access its functionality through `BioStat'20` menu in the menu bar:

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=CAPTION}
    knitr::include_graphics(paste0(fig_dir, "03--biostat-plugin-loaded.png")) 
    
    CAPTION = "" # Figure caption/description.
    ```


### Turn on *BioStat* (green) mode {#turn-on-biostat-mode}

A more convenient way to use the plug-in is to turn on the *BioStat* mode.
This mode uses the green icon instead of the blue one.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=CAPTION}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(fig_dir, "04--activate-biostat-mode.png")) 

CAPTION = "" # Figure caption/description.
```

<br>

In this mode, additional buttons, which enable access to the most common functions, are added below the menu bar:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=CAPTION}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(fig_dir, "05--buttons-in-biostat-mode.png")) 

CAPTION = "" # Figure caption/description.
```

**NOTE:** If an active dataset is not selected, some buttons are shaded in gray and are inactive.

<br>

### Close *BioStat* mode {#close-biostat-mode}

To close this mode, simply restart the *R Commander*: 

* R Commander menu bar → BioStat'20 → Session → Restart R Commander

You may use the following command as well:

```{r eval=FALSE}
restart_commander()
```


### Notes for *Mac* users only {#notes-for-mac-users-only}

For *Mac* users, there at least 2 things to pay attention to:

1) On *Mac*, *R Commander* opens only if [*XQuartz*](http://www.xquartz.org/){target="_blank"} is opened.
So, the first step of using *R Commander* is to make sure that *XQuartz* is opened.
More information on ["Installing R Commander for *Mac* users"](https://murraystate.instructure.com/courses/1252125/pages/installing-r-commander-on-your-mac){target="_blank"}.

2) Some *Mac* users also report that it is impossible to switch between languages while *R Commander* is running.
This means, that some users might not use numbers if in the chosen language the same keys mean some non-English letters. 
Because of this, it is recommended to choose an appropriate language (usually English) before opening *R*/*RStudio*.

# The other useful packages {#related-packages}

Other useful **Rcmdr** plug-ins:

a. **RcmdrPlugin.EZR.as.menu** -- an *R Commander* plugin for the most common statistical analyses (functionality is the same as in **RcmdrPlugin.EZR**, except that **RcmdrPlugin.EZR.as.menu** creates a separate "EZR" menu in a menu bar and does not reorganize the original **Rcmdr** menus in the menu bar);
b. **RcmdrPlugin.KMggplot2** -- an *R Commander* plugin for **ggplot2** graphics.


To install these packages, use the following code:


```{r Install other packages, eval=FALSE}
# RcmdrPlugin.EZR.as.menu
remotes::install_github("GegznaV/RcmdrPlugin.EZR", ref = "ezr_as_menu")

# RcmdrPlugin.KMggplot2
install.packages("RcmdrPlugin.KMggplot2")
```

After the packages are installed, you can load them programmatically:

```{r eval=FALSE}
options(Rcmdr = list(
  plugins = c(
    "RcmdrPlugin.KMggplot2",
    "RcmdrPlugin.EZR.as.menu",
    "RcmdrPlugin.biostat",
    NULL
  ), 
  console.output = FALSE
))

library(Rcmdr)
```

If package **Rcmdr** is loaded **and R Commander window is closed**, instead of ~~`library(Rcmdr)`~~, use this code **exactly once**:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Commander()
```


# Important

Some functions in the package are based on and modified from functions in packages *Rcmdr*<!--, *RcmdrPlugin.KMggplot2*-->, and *RcmdrPlugin.EZR*.
All of those packages are under the GPL-2/GPL-3 license.
